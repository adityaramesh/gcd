# Overview

This is a small C++14 number theory library with the following features:

- gcd and lcm computation using Euclid's algorithm or binary gcd.
- Solution of linear Diophantine equations of the form $ax + by = c$.
- Solution of linear congruences of the form $ax = b (mod c)$.
- Solution of systems of linear congruences, of the form $a_i x = b_i (mod
c_i)$, where the moduli need not be pairwise coprime.
